                <h2>Program Overview</h2>
                <h3><i>Professional, hands-on instruction and creative freedom</i></h3>

                <p>In our Animation degree program, you’ll learn from industry professionals, using the same techniques and tools that you'll eventually need in the workplace. Using state-of-the-art software and hardware, you’ll create your own stories, designs, characters and layouts, and produce your own films.</p>

                </div>

                <h3><i>From story pitch to finished film</i></h3>

                <p>Sheridan’s animation program emphasizes classical principles of animation in a variety of forms, including 2D digital, 3D and stop motion. You’ll learn the art of storyboarding and hone your life drawing, layout and digital painting skills. Working collaboratively or individually on productions, you’ll have the opportunity to explore all aspects of animation filmmaking.</p>

                <h3><i>Career connections</i></h3>

                <p>After Year 3, you’ll gain professional experience during a three-month work placement. And at our annual Industry Day, employers will fly in from across North America to meet you, see your work and conduct interviews.</p>

                <h3><i>Career opportunities</i></h3>

                <p>Employers regard our animators as the cream of the crop; Sheridan graduates routinely go straight to work for top-flight studios and firms in feature films, television animation, gaming and advertising.</p>
